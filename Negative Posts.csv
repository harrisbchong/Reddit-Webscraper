1,UST (a stable coin) is currently down 14%. This is a bigger drop than BTC and most other the top altcoins. A warning about echo chambers.,"I posted only a couple of [days ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ukv56a/terra_luna_has_dropped_almost_three_times_as_much/) warning everyone this was pretty much on the cards. I obviously don’t want to see anyone or anything fail, but it really is important to read everything with an open heart. 

If you straight up ignore all advice that is contrary to what you want to hear, you are setting yourself up for failure. The Safemoon sub is the prime example of the echo chamber that just won’t listen. 

Please. If someone warns you against something, try to find reason in it. Is it possible they are correct? Challenge it, and ask or clarify your misunderstandings. 

I don’t want this post to come across as a “told you so” at all. Although I’m sure many commenters will say exactly that. The point I’m trying to make is to please listen to both sides at all times. It is usually quite easy to discern between someone just spreading FUD and someone who is trying to challenge the merits of a project. 

One thing I do to help me understand all issues is to join the subs or projects I’m not involved in, as well as those I am involved in. I need to hear all sides.",3020,852,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/um4k8s/ust_a_stable_coin_is_currently_down_14_this_is_a/
2,BTC is Officially down 50% from All Time High,"Bitcoin has dropped 50% from its ATH

For me this is an easy buy not necessarily currently but anytime I buy I know that with in time my money will double in the future on any buy below this price. Lots of altcoins out there looking very tempting as well, but one thing I have learned is Id rather have a large portion of my portfolio in BTC when things are on there way down. 

This is a time were you hold solid projects that you truly believe will succeed long term because it will take time for the market to recover. Fill your bags now",2744,759,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ul6unv/btc_is_officially_down_50_from_all_time_high/
3,Bitcoin falls $40k and crypto continuous plunge … Is it time to sell ?,"If you are new in crypto you may fear and panic because of this prices and I can’t blame you, but I just want to tell you about Bitcoin price history

In 2014 … Bitcoin went below $400 and everyone thought that the Digital Gold is gone forever

Then in  2018 … Bitcoin went below $4K and everyone thought that the Digital Gold is gone forever

Then in 2022 … Bitcoin went below $40K and everyone thought that the Digital Gold is gone forever

I am not telling you to buy or sell, I am not telling how much to invest or or what to invest in, I am just telling you the history and don’t worry if you are true believer of crypto and the project you choose to invest in

Also, I can‘t wait to buy more cheap Bitcoin in 2026 when it goes below $400K and everyone is thinking it’s gone forever

5,"Yet again, US markets open, entire crypto market dumps","I've seen this like 20 times in the last year. Everything goes well the entire day in the Asia/Europe markets, but the moment US markets open, everything tanks.

I've had alts doing +15% today, total portfolio was up like 6-7%, all wiped in a matter of 2hrs. Sure, it is related to alts being correlated to BTC. But still. 

What is up with that, US? Why don't you like profits? 

Could it be the blatant market manipulation with options and future? Is it the stock/bonds markets influencing BTC? Is it the interest hike somehow? What gives?",2238,1309,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uj00j2/yet_again_us_markets_open_entire_crypto_market/
6,"What do you mean ""Buy NOW""? We still have room to dump","Not sure what people are on about with their ""Buy buy buy"" posts. I mean, I haven't seen a suicide hotline posts stickied in months now. Some people argue that the fear and greed index (currently at 10) is the right way to go, and normally I agree, but I don't think this is a normal situation. 

History shows us (as far as BTC is concerned), bear market bring a 80% dump to BTC. Sure, sure, now we have a lot of institutional investors involved, who won't allow BTC to go down THAT much. And we're currently 50ish% down from BTC ATH. I was also under the impression that ""this time it's different"" and that BTC drops of around 80% are not as likely. But this is the first time BTC is around in a situation where we have a major global recession. Which is just now starting to show it's ugly teeth. So if you're thinking this is the bottom, you have another thing coming. 

Don't make the mistake in thinking things will get easier over the next few weeks. It is highly likely that people will lose jobs. People will lose homes. We are still in a completely unregulated market. BTC and crypto will dump a lot more from this point. 

If you have a DCA strategy (and available FIAT now), sure, continue to buy weekly/monthly. Nothing wrong with this strategy. It is historically proven this is the best strategy which minimizes risk and general emotional connection with how your portfolio is doing on a daily basis. 

But I'm waiting. I have my buy orders set at $22k (around 65% down from ATH) and all the way down to $11k (a bit over 80% down). Once it hits those levels I'll continue to DCA, and after a month or two, start to buy alts (solid projects, no shitcoins), also DCA. 

I am not making the same mistakes I did the last bear cycle.",688,358,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/umdz5i/what_do_you_mean_buy_now_we_still_have_room_to/
7,Its annoying to see bitcoin follows the stock market,"As the title says, it annoys me that bitcoin is following the nasdaq. Because Bitcoin and other cryptos are supposed to be a hedge against the stock markets corrections. But bitcoin basically follows the stock market. And if a recession happens I want to be making money on crypto so that I doesn’t have to worry about a recession or inflation. I hope it will change in the future so that Bitcoin becomes a digital gold that can be used to hedge against stock market corrections and recessions. 

Does anyone agree with me on this or am I delusional for thinking that crypto should have been the ultimate hedge against inflation and recessions.",655,453,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uijvn6/its_annoying_to_see_bitcoin_follows_the_stock/

10,About one year ago Dogecoin hit 0.70 USD. Now it's about 80% lower. Showing that profit taking is not wrong either sometimes.,"Going back one year. Crypto is in it full ""mania"" stage as the rise of meme coins takes place lead by the godfather of memes, Dogecoin itself. Dogecoin hits about 0.70 crossing the magical 0.69 mark. It's just complete doge hype all over the internet. Investors are already seeing the 1$ mark in front of their eyes.

Here we are one year later. Since then DOGE only was in a downtrend from 0.70$ to 0.12$. Reasons are the overall Crypto dump but also fading interest and hype in the crypto itself. Which they are even trying to tackle right now with actual development and a roadmap. But this is not about doge. This is about not being too overconfident with your investment.

Being to overconfident will lead you to the blinded HODL. While holding may be a very good strategy in crypto its not always. Some cryptos rise others disappear you have to look into the market to know where your investments are heading.

If your crypto look weak over the longterm you should take the profit or if your crypto has done an unsustainable pump you should take a profit. Taking profit is not bad, it's smart and wise, also you always have the option to buy low afterwards.",501,185,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ukm6l2/about_one_year_ago_dogecoin_hit_070_usd_now_its/
11,The Terra/TerraUSD Peg is continuing to slide and looks very bleak. UST currently below .69 and Terra is down 52% today to $30 - Details and a two month old warning from a Redditor inside.,"This is a follow up post to when I noticed it was down 3% which is incredibly dangerous for a stablecoin.

At this point it's a question of - ""will the bleeding stop"" or will UST/Terra Rug itself out of existence?

Two months ago /u/cwm9 made a very detailed post about his concerns with UST. [Which outlined a scenario exactly like this.](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tbcrkh/explain_to_me_how_terraluna_is_not_a_scam/?context=3)

> But go the other way: when people start selling their UST because they want to go back to bitcoin, they mint Luna and sell it. Now the price of Luna goes down. The fact that the price is going down and total coins minted is rising encourages the selling of Luna making the price drop farther. If the price drops too far, it can no longer support the burning of UST to get a dollar by selling Luna.

The response from Reddit was - well yah that's supply/demand + Terra is a lot more than UST there is a whole ecosystem.

Additionally Terra began buying BTC reserves and had over $1B in reserves to prepare for this scenario.

At this point the question isn't will the peg break? The BTC reserves of $1B are likely all gone and nothing is probably left. Nearly 3B in volume in the last 24 hours. The question is, is this the end of Terra?",499,313,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/um5qs6/the_terraterrausd_peg_is_continuing_to_slide_and/
12,"When people say ""Buy the dip! You'll never get another chance to buy at these low prices!"", what they're really saying is ""I just FOMOEd in, pump my bags!""","You know what people were saying around this time last year? The same exact things they're saying now. The crypto market crashed and people were saying buy as much as you can now, because BTC is going to $100k by the end of the year. Now fast forward one year..... Many of the big crypto are at or lower than the prices they were a year ago, we never hit $100k BTC, and people are back to the same old ""Buy now or you'll regret it later"" posts. In short, nobody here actually knows what they're talking about.

People telling you to buy now or you'll regret it later are essentially just telling you to FOMO in. 100% of the people saying it have likely just FOMOed in themselves, and now want you to FOMO in as well to increase their investment. Don't listen to people here. Stick to your own investment plan and ignore the calls to FOMO in now from strangers on Reddit. Prices may very well go back up quickly and you missed your chance to buy cheap crypto, but they could just as well keep falling below the next support and you've just FOMOed into comparatively expensive crypto. Have your own investment plan and stick to it.

**TL;DR:** The people here don't know anything. They just pretend they do. Have your own investment plan and stick to it. Ignore the people telling you to FOMO in on Reddit.",472,122,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/um5hax/when_people_say_buy_the_dip_youll_never_get/
13,"A year ago today, ICP was listed on Coinbase, reached $700 and immediately entered the top 10. Yesterday, it fell below $10 for the first time.","A  year ago today, May 10, 2021, a new coin seemed to suddenly appear out of nowhere for most of us: a coin with the pretty weird name Internet Computer (ICP). It had the most explosive start of any coin I've ever seen. It entered the top 10 immediately, [even went to #4](https://web.archive.org/web/20210511041514/https://coinmarketcap.com/) for a few hours, with only BTC, ETH and BNB ahead of it. On the first day it was even listed on sites like Coingecko and Coinmarketcap! I remember thinking this was a bug when there suddenly was a new coin in the top 10.

Today, it is sitting solidly below $15, even went below $10 yesterday - what happened? Well, $700 was just absurdly overpriced, it seems. But to be fair, ICP has had incredibly bad luck with its timing, as it was released just days before Bitcoin's biggest crash in recent history, which dragged the whole market down with it. On May 10, BTC opened at **above $58**, only 3 days later it opened below $50k and kept going down, to a low of  **$30,681.50** on May 19.

ICP was hit too, but much harder - I would guess it would have gone down from $700 even in a good market. There was quite a bit of up and down in the first few days, but it (at least temporarily, respectively) went below $400 on May 11, below $300 on May 12, below $200 on May 17 and below $100 on May 19. **That's $700 to below $100 in nine days.** There were a few ups and downs in the following days but it permanently went below $100 on June 8, less than a month after its release, and never returned.

You know what's impressive, though? You would expect a coin that has fallen more than 98% to be at like rank 300 or something at best. But nope, it is still sitting somewhere around #40 - **that's how absurdly high its market cap was!**

Happy birthday ICP, I'm curios where you'll be in a year!",380,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/umcs1r/a_year_ago_today_icp_was_listed_on_coinbase/
14,"Safemoon CEO John Karony squanders $150,000 of Investor funds on a shitcoin, now worth $5,000 - a 96.6% loss","This is one of those truly remarkable things which I personally think elevates Safemoon to #1 Crypto scam, far above Bitconnect.  

[In the latest Coffeezilla video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIUrE7Ovm5k), our intrepid investigator finally confirmed that John Karony, the CEO of Safemoon, definitively owns the infamous ""Gabe"" wallet - the BSC wallet that ends in ""6abe""  

I might make a future post about this, but a quick summary is that the Gabe wallet bought a ""Moondog"" NFT, which John then tweeted about, and also wrote an instagram post about moving it. He also attended Austin SXSW and received an exclusive NFT that is transferred to your wallet for attendees only.  

This (among other evidence) was the smoking gun and confirmed John's ownership of said wallet, **which was previously highlighted as problematic as it has been receiving millions of dollars from Bitmart which was supposed to be sent to the liquidity pool**, and yet these funds are being withdrawn as cash or spent on frivolous items.

---

With that out the way, we know that Karony owns this wallet, [and he received a tip off from the slimy Ben Phillips](https://imgur.com/6zSJko3) to buy some shitcoin called ""Stonks"".  

[On that same day, Karony bought $150,000 worth of Stonks](https://bscscan.com/token/0xb966150c7a0150ed4ea979e04f18d109301aab95?a=0xd51d1d5503dcff819e214faa66c3b6f0ebb06abe), becoming the 2nd largest token holder.  

Unfortunately, John's investing savvy is secondly only to his FUD-fighting savvy, and his FUD-fighting savvy is fucking awful, and so I regret to say that his $150,000 worth of Stonks tokens are now... alas...  

#$5,107.46..  

##That's a 96.6% loss.

---

If this was his own money, who gives a shit. But to actually misuse taxed funds from investors which was supposed to go into the liquidity pool to help secure price stability of Safemoon, in order to buy cringey worthless NFT's and hundreds of thousands of dollars of shit tokens is a new low.  

Especially considering Safemoon currently has a very serious liquidity issue. With just over $6m in BNB liquidity left, it only takes a couple whales to drain the LP and slam the door shut on everyone else.

15,Take this downtime to learn a blockchain programming language.,"I know we all want to get rich with crypto, but it might take a while. We all love the crypto/blockchain space or we wouldn't be here, so why not learn the programming languages that make them work? We can take a proactive approach. It might lead to getting a job in the crypto space, which could make us more than investing at this point.

The top blockchain programming languages to learn include (but are not limited to):

**1. Solidity**

* Solidity is developer-friendliness.
* Apart from Ethereum, you can use solidity for programming smart contracts on other platforms like Monax.
* It offers accessibility to JavaScript infrastructures, debuggers, and other tools.
* Statically typed programming.
* Feasibility of inheritance properties in smart contracts.
* It gives you precise accuracy

**Some Examples of blockchain projects that use Solidity:**

* Ethereum
* Chainlink
* Sushiswap
* Compound Protocol

**2. Java**

* Java provides extensive support for OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) methodology.
* The facility of memory cleaning.
* Availability of extensive libraries.

**Some Examples of blockchain projects that use Java:**

* NEM
* Ethereum
* NEO
* Hyperledger
* Fabric

**3. Python**

* Python gives access to dynamic architecture.
* It is the perfect language for base and scripting approaches.
* It offers open-source support.
* In Python, blockchain coding is efficient for prototyping.

**Some Examples of blockchain projects that use Python:**

* Hyperledger Fabric
* Ethereum
* NEO
* Steemit

**4. Golang**

* Golang is user-friendly.
* It is scalable, flexible, and offers high speed.
* Golang combines C++, Java, and Python features to create a reliable and fun language to use for blockchain development.

**Some Examples of blockchain projects that use Golang:**

* GoChain
* Dero
* Loom Network
* Ethereum
* Hyperledger Fabric

**5. C++**

* C++ has efficient CPU management and memory control.

* It gives you the facility for code isolation for different data structures and more.

**Some Examples of blockchain projects that use C++:**

* Monero
* Ripple
* EOS
* Stellar
* Litecoin

There's a lot of free online resources to learn these languages. I've been using Codeacademy for years; I'm currently learning Python with their courses. It's free; there's a pro-version, but I have always used the free courses, which have been awesome. They don't offer courses on all the languages listed above, so if anyone has some other free learning resources to share, please do so.

Edit: Thanks to some helpful commenters including u/cheeruphumanity, I'm adding Rust to this list:

""I would add Rust to that list so people can get into Scrypto. Radix is currently one of the most exciting technologies in the crypto space and has a very active dev community.""

Edit: Removed IOTA from the Java list per some helpful comment suggestions.",309,178,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ukby1i/take_this_downtime_to_learn_a_blockchain/
16,"You cant call everything FUD and hide in a echo chamber, sometimes admitting you messed up and taking the loss is best.","In these dark times it is important to remember to keep an open mind and view your investments critically, don't let hope blind you. Being exposed to dissenting opinions about your investments could help you avoid being the bag holder of a scam project.

echo chamber:

> An echo chamber is ""an environment where a person only encounters information or opinions that reflect and reinforce their own."" 

# People become blinded by the idea of becoming rich quickly

The biggest problem with joining coin/token specific subreddits is that you block out any information that could help you get out of said scam. If you visit some of these meme coins subs they truly believe that the project they are invested in can do incredible things, now this is either due to them not understanding exactly what they purchased or because of lies spread inside the subs.

>  
>It can be tempting to jump on a trend if you see other people making money — or at least claiming to. “It takes a great amount of self control not to want to do what other people are doing, let alone a celebrity that you love,” says [Kiana Danial](https://investdiva.com/), founder of Invest Diva and author of “Cryptocurrency Investing for Dummies.”

>This happened with penny stocks and during the dot-com bubble, because people didn’t understand what was going on but they wanted in, says Danial. “We had a lot of catastrophic results, and cryptocurrency is the same,” she says. “The reason why people are falling for it is because they’re not educated.”

To see an example of some of these echo chambers on reddit, I went to some meme coin subs so you wouldn't have to. All of these examples are taken by filtering top post from the last week, I also tried to leave the upvote amounts so you could see these post got a bit of traction in those individual communities.

If any of these post were made on r/cc they would probably be laughed at and mocked for being delusional, but inside those individual subreddits they are viewed as hopeful, dissenting opinions are downvoted and called FUD. It's best to continue to view each of your individual investments with a critical mind, don't shut out others opinions.

* don't lock yourself inside and echo chamber where you will only hear positive opinions
*  continue to research the projects you are investing in. 
* don't fall in love with your investment",300,87,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uibeaa/you_cant_call_everything_fud_and_hide_in_a_echo/

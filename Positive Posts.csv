In a letter filed with SEC, Elon has disclosed backing for upto $7 BN for his proposed takeover of Twitter, from big names such as Brookfield, Fidelity, Qatar, Sequoia and now Binance too!

As per the filing, Binance the largest cryptocurrency exchange has commited upto $500,000,000 in cash towards Musk's takeover and aquistition of Twitter. 

The deal would mark Binance's entry into the big league of investors who are willing to contribute towards deals outside the traditional crypto space.

1,"If you aren’t buying now, you will regret your choice","Let me start off by saying that a lot of us are facing an acute shortage of fiat aka money to invest and are probably balls deep.

Lets just look at the bloodbath right now

[The market right now](https://preview.redd.it/ky9skqra7hy81.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=feb5d44fd0a0903353c467b27d7a6a7bd51caa54)

BTC - ATH is $68,789.63 and the current price is 33,279$. When we reachieve ATH, that will be over 100% increase. Which means you are doubling the money that you are putting in by buying now.

Similarly with ETH. ATH is $4,891.70 and the current price is 2,413$. Again when we reach ATH, you are looking at a 2x of what you have invested.

But those of you who have money but haven't bought BTC at this price, in the hopes that

1. The price will go even lower. That is Greed. You aren’t even taking this opportunity now to get a 2x, then trust me, every time it goes lower, you will wait for a new low. And when prices rebound, you will still wait for the “crash” only to finally fomo near the top.
2. The market is too volatile, I might lose my money. Well, this is crypto. You should invest what you can afford to remove maybe a year or two later. Don’t imagine Bitcoin to make you a millionaire overnight. But if you invest too much, it can make you broke in no time as well.
3. The potential of BTC is over. I need to find the next 1000x ultra micro cap coin. Well if you are colorblind, the market is red now. Good luck finding an alt coin that statistically might not survive the bear market.

TLDR - Agreed that crypto is volatile as hell. But within this space, the most safest and blue chip investment are at prices which will net you double the returns.  What is stopping you from investing at least a portion of your investment money now ?",2551,1879,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ulvokw/if_you_arent_buying_now_you_will_regret_your/
2,"Five months ago, I combed through all the posts here to find the subs most despised coins. I combined into a single awful folio. This is an update on the FOLIO OF HATE. How much do you want it to fail? Does it still make you angry?","Good morning all,

We're in a bear market. Shit sucks. But that doesn't mean we can't still have some fun right?

For those that were around at the beginning of the year, you might remember that I created this. The FOLIO OF HATE. I invested (yolo'd?) $100 into this subs most hated coins. Some coins are hated because of utility, some because of corruption, some because of the the shills. Whatever the reason, I decided to act on the theory that this sub can actually pick winners by investing into the ones that we all hate the most.

So, $100 was invested on the same day to each of the ten coins/tokens. Here is how it fared.

[Folio of Hate](https://preview.redd.it/nfz7ezwmz8y81.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ac739a8375280fe14e47eb7564c5a1d6d7fc0e)

Down 46% or $460 in five months.

What about the individual results? Surely they're not all bad? Right?

**Best performer:** USDT -0.01 %

**Worst performer:** LRC -70.13 %

**Surprise Performer:** DOGE -31.01%

Personal points of interest:

* Investing in Dogecoin - yes Dogecoin - was a better investment than Solana, Cardano, Ripple and Binance.
* Safemoon was not the predicted worst performer ...yet.
* Tether - FUCKING TETHER - was the folios best performer. Props to u/entschida for getting that one right.

I am aware that perceptions and opinions shift over time, so it is of course possible that we hate these coins more than ever. Oh, and fuck you Crypto.com

>Well after a long and exhaustive battle of coins being shilled in just a couple of hours, I have found the list of the subs most hated coins. There was definitely a lot of hate out there. I put $100 into each and stored it on a seperate group of wallets to my real bags. To make it easier to track, I create the folio of hate using coinmarketcap to track them more easily. I'll post the updates every month and hope to see some big gains going against us all (even my most hated coin is in this group).

3,El Salvador just bought the dip again,"Just 25 mins ago El Salvador president Nayib Bukele announced he bought another 500 coins at $30,774.

Somebody made a website to show the purchase history and it looks like they are down 33%:

Even if this is the lowest purchase so far, it's already gone down:

Bitcoin current price is $30,642. El Saldavor's DCA average is $45,908.42.

And looks like the experiment hasn't gone well lately. A study by a U.S.-based think tank, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), said only 20% of Salvadorans have continued to use the nationally issued and technically flawed digital wallet needed to spend bitcoin.

4,Fed meeting: raising rates by the expected half percent. JPOW feeling more optimistic with economic numbers. Stock are going up. What this all means for markets and crypto...,"Bullish news overall, at least short term.

# Background: how high are those Fed rates eventually gonna go and how big is the effect?

It's important to keep things in perspective.

Lowering or increasing rates, doesn't necessarily mean we'll have very high or very low rates.

In fact, Fed rates are only going up from a near 0 floor. We're not jumping from high rates to higher rates.

The long term plan by the Fed is to target around 2 -2.5%.

This is far from being high rates. These are still low rates designed more to stimulate an economy. With cost of borrowing still not very expensive.

In fact, 2% is simply going back to 2020 rates and the pre-covid normal.

&#x200B;

# The key points of the JPOW's meeting:

\-0.5 fed hikes as expected, following the roadmap to 2%.

\-75 basis points moved off the table. This lowers a lot of uncertainty.

\-Unemployment at one of the lowest in 50 years.

\-Wages moving up.

\-According to JPOW, inflation has likely peaked, and expects it to go down.

\-The economy is ""not vulnerable to a recession"" and ""the economy is doing fairly well"" according to JPOW.

\-JPOW's tone has changed since the last meeting. From a somber dovish tone, to a more hawkish and optimistic tone.

&#x200B;

# What does it mean for Bitcoin and ultimately crypto?

The US has the biggest share of the Bitcoin market, so while this may seem very US-centric, what happens in the US could affect the crypto market.

Probably not as much as most people would expect.

While the correlation between Bitcoin and US stocks has increased since Covid, it has only increased from nearly 0 and weak correlation, to only a moderate and inconsistent correlation.

The correlation works more strongly, when the crypto market is already more vulnerable to move in that direction.

Right now, crypto has been testing lows, and may have been forming a bottom.

If stocks do well and go up, it could help boost crypto in going in the path of least resistance, which right now is up.

There is one important effect that should still affect the crypto market: liquidity.

Even if whales trading bots don't care about the cost of a car loan increasing, they do care about liquidity coming into the market.

&#x200B;

# Additional data about the current state of the US economy:

US real GDP growth has decreased at a rate of about 1.4% this quarter.

Unemployment is down to 3.8%.

Consumer expenditure has increased 2.7% despite inflation.

Residential investment has gone up 2%.

The trade gap has increased to $110 Billion.

Covid cases have been steadily rising this year to about 30K per day for the US. They are still much lower than last summer, and compared to the major part of 2021.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion:

The policy remains the same: kicking the can down the road.

Don't bet the farm on a great depression just yet. It's possible, but... realize that it's not the only scenario at play. We are still at a tipping point where it could go either way.

We are still in a potential scenario where this was just a correction. Likely more due to the extra liquidity turned off, and liquidity getting more back to normal, and the market having to re-adjust to reality with no more extra money printed.

So it's not completely out of the question that the stock market could eventually resume its run, as businesses re-open, supply chains unclog, economic growth picks up again, inflation stabilizes, and maybe even the war in Ukraine ends or becomes less uncertain.

If markets pick up again, that will be very good for bringing back liquidity into crypto, along with confidence. 

For now, the more short term result of this meeting on crypto, the odds favoring going for the path of least resistance to test $40K again.",572,202,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uiech3/fed_meeting_raising_rates_by_the_expected_half/
5,"There will come a point when most people, including many here, will be convinced that crypto is actually dead and will never recover. That is the best time to buy.","Sentiment is a difficult thing to judge. People may seem negative about crypto now, but I think most of us would agree that we are still bullish on crypto in general for the mid to long term future.

While this is not the worst time to buy, there will probably be a years long period relatively soon where the sentiment around crypto is that it is dead and will legitimately never recover.

It wont just be normal people saying this, that will be the sentiment on this sub for many as well. You yourself will start to wonder if crypto can recover, and will probably start to think that crypto could actually just be dead. 

As strange as it may seem now, it will be really really difficult to convince yourself to buy at that point. While the prices will be incredibly low, the overall sentiment will be that crypto will never see ATH ever again, and you won't want to buy.

That will be the best time to buy, as it has been in the past, and we aren’t close to that point yet. We still have many more months, maybe even a year or more before that point. A good barometer for the bottom will be when you yourself start to think that crypto could be dead and will not recover. Those who have the conviction to buy at that point will make out the best in the next bull run, just like they have in the past.",311,119,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uluae3/there_will_come_a_point_when_most_people/
6,"So i hate to ask, but how is El Salvador doing? I haven’t heard a “they bought the dip” in a while","It looks like there is a lot of panicking going around right now. Not just on reddit Cc or in El Salvador because El presidente yolo’d into btc at the top, but everywhere…

War, incoming famine, inflation,crash,climate,nuclear attacks…

Everything seems quite gloomy, and i can definitely imagine people selling of to cover other needs right now.

But i can’t help wonder, how is El Salvador managing this on a public level? Can’t imagine shopkeepers are very happy!?

Ofcourse like most here, i think the future still holds great things for btc. And friends, but when you are a country, how long can you be in the red? Does it work differently when they can’t take profits to cover other expenses for a longer period of time?

Maybe we can get a comment from someone out of El Salvador? Would love to hear the down-low.

7,"If you want to know the best time to buy, it is historically one year after whenever a new Bitcoin ATH is hit, which means that will be November of this year.","In 2014, it went from $1000 in December of 2013 to around $200 in December of 2014 one year later.

In 2017 it went from $19,000 in December of 2017 to $4,000 in December of 2018 one year later.

In 2022 we reached two ATH's but the most recent one was around $69,000 in November of 2021. Many think we will have a lower low this time, but if the trend continues we will see November of 2022 being the best time to buy. 

Obviously this is not a fact and only analysis, but it is based on history of bitcoin's price which is the only thing we have to look at and analyze. The best time to buy seems to always be one year after a previous Bitcoin ATH. This is likely because one year is enough time in people's minds to forget the investment/hype and sell, but also enough time  to reach the long-term tax status instead of short-term and not get hit hard on taxes.

8,So people who have been around since 2017 when are you buying back in?,"I was astounded just how low my alt portfolio went in 2018 and 2019. So many good buying opportunities. I was able to take advantage of them a bit, but not nearly as much as I would have if I’d sold on the way up in late 2017.

From the peak of early 2018 to the very bottom, my portfolio was down 98%!

This time I sold on the way up in 2021. I ended up selling out completely. 

I am not waiting for a 98% drop again, but I think we’ve got a way to go yet. The same alt portfolio this time around is only down 75% from ath.

If BTC goes down another 30% I think alts would go down at least twice as much or more. Probably alt prices a 1/4 of what they are now is realistic. I wouldn’t think that would be rock bottom- that might be half as low again. In 2018, 2019 I learned that anywhere remotely near the bottom would have been good buying. For example 96% down from ath was still double rock bottom and great buying.

The dca crowd need not comment really. Or I can do it for you. Dca is the way. Don’t try to time the market. There we can move on now to some sensible decisions. (Dca near the ath in a clear downtrend is a pretty basic strategy and there is room to improve on that imo)",201,394,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ukoi1x/so_people_who_have_been_around_since_2017_when/
9,This whole CRO fiasco illustrates how misled people are by the HODL mentality,"Just go look on the Crytpo\_com subreddit and you'll see what I mean, so many people seem to be angry at CDC, saying how they hodled like they were meant to at 0.90 and watched it dump to now, as if they've been treated unfairly as speculators.

The sad truth is that the staking rewards and card rewards CDC were handing out were never gonna be sustainable. Soon enough the \[trigger warning\] ponzi scheme was gonna come crashing down. CDC is a company in a sector with very little regulation and they were always gonna try make as much of a profit as possible. Does anyone really think they care about the CRO holders? CDC was offloading their bags up at 0.90.

AND THE STAKING REWARDS AREN'T EVEN THE MOST SUSPICIOUS PART.

Kris Marszalek, current CDC CEO also happens to be the former CEO of a company known as [Ensogo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensogo), a now defunct social commerce website, basically connecting buyers and sellers of unused vouchers and discounts for different things. The company abruptly shut down with Marszalek simultaneously stepping down from his position in 2016, amid [allegations of fraud](https://librehash.org/crypto-com-anatomy-of-a-cryptocurrency-scam-part-two/) from business partners. And that was before the whole Monaco business even started.

The bottom line here is we in the crypto sphere have gotten too used to promoting fantastical gains and easy financial wins just by HODLing and being a good boy. We romanticize our tokens far too much, understandably though because it represents our wealth, and makes us feel intelligent for ""choosing the right one"". But for most of the remaining CRO bagholders, CDC chose them. It chose them with the well targeted reddit ads, the insanely aggressive sports marketing, and the allure of it's too-good-to-be-true promises about VISAs and staking. But anyone who questions that is written off as a non-believer, or NGMI.   
  
The ridiculous gains one can potentially realize in crypto make us far too blind to the real monetary risks we're taking betting on unregulated for-profit exchanges peddling false promises, then patting one another on the back for HODLing, especially in these macro-economic conditions. You think CDC announced their staking rate changes a couple of days before the fed rate hike by coincidence? Please, for your own sake, don't HODL and then get angry when you lose money. Question your own convictions and take extra time to really, really learn what it is you're getting into, or the lambo dream will make you lose sight of what you're getting involved in.",193,245,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/uid3y0/this_whole_cro_fiasco_illustrates_how_misled/
